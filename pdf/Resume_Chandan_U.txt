Academic Projects:
------------------
1. Client project: Scientometric Analysis of Interpreting Journals (Python, R, leaflet, shiny, google geocoding API)
    
    a. Collected data and analyzed trends in the domain of interpreting studies using visualizations such as word clouds, co-authorship networks, topic burst analysis over time, geospatial analysis of trends etc.
    b. Project Website: https://chandan-u.shinyapps.io/scientometric_analysis/

2. Occupancy Detection using Room Attributes (Python, NumPy, Keras)
    a. Implemented a prediction model to detect room occupancy which uses room attributes such as temperature, humidity etc. (A classification problem)
    b. The source code and the analysis of the results is present here: https://github.com/chandan-u/Occupancy-Detection-Prediction-models

3. Storytelling through data (R, tidyr, ggplot2, plotly)
    a. Safety and Neighborhoods: SFO, Wrote a story using San Francisco crime data to explain which neighborhood is safe in San Francisco. Used various visualizations and data analysis techniques.

4. Graph Search based Recommendation System (Python).
    a. Implemented a movie recommendation system that uses graph traversal techniques such as BSF etc. instead of traditional Machine learning algorithms. 
    b. Used collaborative filtering and content based filtering techniques over MovieLens dataset.
    c. The source code and analysis can be found here: https://github.com/chandan-u/graph-based-recommendation-system

5. Semantic Web (Apache Jena, SPARQL, RDF)
    a. Created an application that reads and visualizes RDF dataset of Indiana University's Researchers. 
    b. Making smart inferences from the RDF data, using Jena and Sparql.

6. SUSY Data Set: A classification problem (Python, NumPy)
    a. Implemented various machine learning algorithms from scratch such as Neural Networks, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression with and without regularization, Radial Basis function network etc. and applied them on SUSY Data Set. 
    b. Code: https://github.com/chandan-u/Machine-learning-Algorithms

7. Facial Sentiment Analysis (Python, NumPy, Theano, Keras)
    a. Implemented convolution neural networks for predicting sentiments in facial images. 
    b. The source code can be found here: https://github.com/chandan-u/FacialSentimentAnalysis
    c. It was a classification problem for predicting six emotions. The dataset was taken from kaggle.
